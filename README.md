# Miscellaneous Open Source Data And Brief Analysis

I store some of the open source data I am interested in here.

`Data` is where I keep raw data. 
`Cleaned Data` is where I put processed data.
`Scripts` is where I keep cleaning/processing scripts
`Notebooks` is where I put some brief analysis notebooks, usually using RMarkdown
