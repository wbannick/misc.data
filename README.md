# Miscellaneous Open Source Data And Brief Analysis

I store some of the open source data I am interested in here.

`Data` is where I keep raw data. <br>
`Cleaned Data` is where I put processed data. <br>
`Scripts` is where I keep cleaning/processing scripts <br>
`Markdowns` is where I put some brief analysis documents created using RMarkdown <br>
